## Grid Learning

This repository contains a demonstration of the reinforcment learning algorithms [Q-learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q-learning) and [SARSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State-Action-Reward-State-Action). Contained is a [Python script](../master/grid-learning.py) that will initialize and navigate simple square grid with initial and goal states defined.

This project was created for a Machine Learning course (CS 5033) at the University of Oklahoma during the Fall 2016 semester.
